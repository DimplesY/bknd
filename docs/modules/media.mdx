   - Pre-built support for S3, S3-compatible services (e.g., R2, Tigris), and Cloudinary.
   - Extend functionality by implementing custom adapters.
- **Entity Integration**: Attach media files directly to entities for seamless data association.
- **Content Delivery**: Serve media over an API endpoint or directly from your provider.

The media tools are designed to integrate effortlessly into your workflows, offering scalability
and control without added complexity.

### Pre-built support for S3

There are two ways to enable S3 or S3 compatible storage in bknd. 

1. Enable via the admin UI.

Simply navigate to the **Media** tab of the bknd admin UI and enable the S3 media support. 
Enter your AWS S3-compatible storage Access Key, Secret Access Key, and URL. 
This will automatically configure the S3 adapter for you. 

2. Enable programatically.

To enable using a code-first approach, create an [Initial Structure](/usage/database#initial-structure) using the 
`initialConfig` option in your `bknd.config.ts` file. 

```typscript bknd.config.ts
import type { BkndConfig } from "bknd/adapter";

export default {
   initialConfig: {
      media: {
         enabled: true,
         adapter: {
            type: "s3",
            config: {
               access_key: "<key>",
               secret_access_key: "<secret key>",
               url: "<bucket url>"
            }
         }
      }
  }
} satisfies BkndConfig;
```

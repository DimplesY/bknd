Not only creating and maintaing a backend is time-consuming, but also integrating it into your frontend can be a hassle. With `bknd/elements`, you can easily add media uploads and authentication forms to your app without having to figure out API details.

## Media uploads

```tsx
import { Media } from "bknd/elements"

export function UserAvatar() {
   return <Media.Dropzone
     entity={{ name: "users", id: 1, field: "avatar" }}
     maxItems={1}
     overwrite
   />
}
```

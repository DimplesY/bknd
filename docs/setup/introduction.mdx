There are several methods to get **bknd** up and running. You can choose between these options:
1. [Run it using the CLI](/cli): That's the easiest and fastest way to get started.
2. Use a runtime like [Node](/integration/node), [Bun](/integration/bun) or
[Cloudflare](/integration/cloudflare) (workerd). This will run the API and UI in the runtime's
native server and serves the UI assets statically from `node_modules`.
3. Run it inside your React framework of choice like [Next.js](/integration/nextjs),
[Astro](/integration/astro) or [Remix](/integration/remix).

There is also a fourth option, which is running it inside a
[Docker container](/integration/docker). This is essentially a wrapper around the CLI.

## Basic setup
Regardless of the method you choose, at the end all adapters come down to the actual
instantiation of the `App`, which in raw looks like this:

```ts
import { createApp, type CreateAppConfig } from "bknd";

// create the app
const config = { /* ... */ } satisfies CreateAppConfig;
const app = createApp(config);

// build the app
await app.build();

// export for Web API compliant envs
export default app;
```

In Web API compliant environments, all you have to do is to default exporting the app, as it
implements the `Fetch` API.

## Configuration (`CreateAppConfig`)
The `CreateAppConfig` type is the main configuration object for the `createApp` function. It has
the following properties:
```ts
import type { Connection } from "bknd/data";
import type { Config } from "@libsql/client";

type AppPlugin = (app: App) => Promise<void> | void;
type LibSqlCredentials = Config;

type CreateAppConfig = {
   connection?:
      | Connection
      | {
           type: "libsql";
           config: LibSqlCredentials;
        };
   initialConfig?: InitialModuleConfigs;
   plugins?: AppPlugin[];
   options?: {
      basePath?: string;
      trustFetched?: boolean;
      onFirstBoot?: () => Promise<void>;
      seed?: (ctx: ModuleBuildContext) => Promise<void>;
   };
};
```
### `connection`
The `connection` property is the main connection object to the database. It can be either an
object with a type specifier (only `libsql` is supported at the moment) and the actual
`Connection` class. The `libsql` connection object looks like this:

```ts
const connection = {
   type: "libsql",
   config: {
      url: string;
      authToken?: string;
   };
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass an instance of a `Connection` class directly,
see [Custom Connection](/setup/database#custom-connection) as a reference.

If the connection object is omitted, the app will try to use an in-memory database.

### `initialConfig`
As initial configuration, you can either pass a partial configuration object or a complete one
with a version number. The version number is used to automatically migrate the configuration up
to the latest version upon boot. The default configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "admin": {
      "basepath": "",
      "color_scheme": "light",
      "logo_return_path": "/"
    },
    "cors": {
      "origin": "*",
      "allow_methods": ["GET", "POST", "PATCH", "PUT", "DELETE" ],
      "allow_headers": ["Content-Type", "Content-Length", "Authorization", "Accept"]
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "basepath": "/api/data",
    "entities": {},
    "relations": {},
    "indices": {}
  },
  "auth": {
    "enabled": false,
    "basepath": "/api/auth",
    "entity_name": "users",
    "allow_register": true,
    "jwt": {
      "secret": "",
      "alg": "HS256",
      "fields": ["id", "email", "role"]
    },
    "cookie": {
      "path": "/",
      "sameSite": "lax",
      "secure": true,
      "httpOnly": true,
      "expires": 604800,
      "renew": true,
      "pathSuccess": "/",
      "pathLoggedOut": "/"
    },
    "strategies": {
      "password": {
        "type": "password",
        "config": {
          "hashing": "sha256"
        }
      }
    },
    "roles": {}
  },
  "media": {
    "enabled": false,
    "basepath": "/api/media",
    "entity_name": "media",
    "storage": {}
  },
  "flows": {
    "basepath": "/api/flows",
    "flows": {}
  }
}
```

You can use the CLI to get the default configuration:
```sh
npx bknd config --pretty
```

To validate your configuration against a JSON schema, you can also dump the schema using the CLI:
```sh
npx bknd schema
```

To create an initial data structure, you can use helpers [described here](/setup/database#initial-structure).

### `plugins`
The `plugins` property is an array of functions that are called after the app has been built,
but before its event is emitted. This is useful for adding custom routes or other functionality.
A simple plugin that adds a custom route looks like this:

```ts
export const myPlugin: AppPlugin = (app) => {
   app.server.get("/hello", (c) => c.json({ hello: "world" }));
};
```

Since each plugin has full access to the `app` instance, it can add routes, modify the database
structure, add custom middlewares, respond to or add events, etc. Plugins are very powerful, so
make sure to only run trusted ones.

### `options`
This object is passed to the `ModuleManager` which is responsible for:
- validating and maintaining configuration of all modules
- building all modules (data, auth, media, flows)
- maintaining the `ModuleBuildContext` used by the modules

The `options` object has the following properties:
- `basePath` (`string`): The base path for the Hono instance. This is used to prefix all routes.
- `trustFetched` (`boolean`): If set to `true`, the app will not perform any validity checks for
the given or fetched configuration.
- `onFirstBoot` (`() => Promise<void>`): A function that is called when the app is booted for
the first time.
- `seed` (`(ctx: ModuleBuildContext) => Promise<void>`): A function that is called when the app is
booted for the first time and an initial partial configuration is provided.


## `ModuleBuildContext`
```ts
type ModuleBuildContext = {
   connection: Connection;
   server: Hono;
   em: EntityManager;
   emgr: EventManager;
   guard: Guard;
};
```

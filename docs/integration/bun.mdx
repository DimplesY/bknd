import InstallBknd from '/snippets/install-bknd.mdx';

## Installation
Install bknd as a dependency:
<InstallBknd />

## Serve the API & static files
The `serve` function of the Bun adapter makes sure to also serve the static files required for
the admin panel.

``` tsx
// index.ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/bun";

// if the configuration is omitted, it uses an in-memory database
serve({
   connection: {
      type: "libsql",
      config: {
         url: process.env.DB_URL!,
         authToken: process.env.DB_AUTH_TOKEN!
      }
   }
});
```
For more information about the connection object, refer to the [Setup](/setup/introduction) guide.

Run the application using Bun by executing:
```bash
bun run index.ts
```

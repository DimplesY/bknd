import InstallBknd from '/snippets/install-bknd.mdx';

## Installation
Install bknd as a dependency:
<InstallBknd />

## Serve the API & static files
The `serve` function of the Node adapter makes sure to also serve the static files required for
the admin panel.

``` tsx
// index.js
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/node";

// if the configuration is omitted, it uses an in-memory database
/** @type {import("bknd/adapter/node").NodeAdapterOptions} */
const config = {
   connection: {
      type: "libsql",
      config: {
         url: ":memory:"
      }
   }
};

serve(config);
```
For more information about the connection object, refer to the [Setup](/setup) guide.

Run the application using node by executing:
```bash
node index.js
```
